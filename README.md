# nc_luxgate
Very occult, super spooky, definitely not christian transportation system.

Core Principles:
- Limited distance, instantaneous transportation between locations within a nodecore world.

- Utilize cutting edge resources with a bit of a throwback to the lode age, to construct "Lode pylons" and eventually the grand "luxgate".

- Four in-world structures, and one new node.

- Extremely occult, not for the faint of heart or faint of logical reasoning.
